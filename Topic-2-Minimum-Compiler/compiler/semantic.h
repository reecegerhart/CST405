 *  TOPIC 2 · Compiler for a Starter Language
 * FILE: semantic.h   —   Phase 3 — Semantic analysis
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PIPELINE, AND WHERE THIS FILE SITS IN IT
 *   scanner -> parser -> ast -> semantic -> tac -> codegen
 *                               ^^^^^^^^  this file
 *
 * UNCHANGED SINCE TOPIC 1 — the interfaces held, which is the point
 *
 * WHAT COMES NEXT
 *   Topic 3 adds functions, arrays and the rest of arithmetic — and with them, real activation records.
 *
 * YOUR TASK
 *   This is Project 2: the first compiler you build end to end.  Sections
 *   marked  TODO (Topic 2)  are yours.  Everything else — the headers, the
 *   scanner, the driver, the register allocator — is given, because the
 *   point of this project is the six PHASES, not the plumbing between them.
